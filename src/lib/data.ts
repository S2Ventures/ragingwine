The logic is sound even if it takes a moment to adjust: limestone soils tend to produce wines with higher acidity and mineral backbone, clay soils yield riper and fuller-bodied wines, volcanic soils bring smoky intensity. Once you understand the framework, you are actually choosing wine by flavor profile rather than geography, which pairs more naturally with food. The list features artisan producers, small-production bottles, off-the-beaten-path selections from Slovenia, Armenia, and Lebanon, plus natural wines and Southern producers.
