    overview: 'Let\'s set expectations: Georgia is not Napa. It\'s not Sonoma. If you drive out to North Georgia wine country expecting the same polished tasting rooms and decades-deep cellar programs, you\'re going to be disappointed. But if you show up with an open mind, a sense of adventure, and an appreciation for people who are genuinely passionate about making this work, you\'re going to have a great time. Georgia is home to roughly 44 active wineries, with the vast majority clustered in the North Georgia mountains within a two-hour drive of Atlanta. The state has two recognized AVAs: the Dahlonega Plateau AVA (designated 2018) and the Upper Hiwassee Highlands AVA (shared with North Carolina). The Dahlonega Plateau sits at 1,500+ feet elevation with clay-loam soils that are genuinely well-suited for grape growing. The quality is improving every year. A handful of producers are making wines that earn national medals in blind competitions, and the gap between Georgia and more established regions is narrowing. What Georgia does offer is something unique: picturesque mountain vineyards, live music on the patio, friendly people who are happy to talk about what they\'re growing, and a relaxed atmosphere that makes for a genuinely fun day out. Support the local growers. Their passion and investment today is what builds a real wine region tomorrow. Go out, Drink Boldly, and enjoy the ride.',

  overview: 'South Carolina is not going to win any blind tastings against Oregon or Washington. Let\'s just get that out there. But here\'s what SC does have: roughly 25 active wineries spread across three distinct touring zones, a subtropical climate that muscadine grapes actually love, and one operation (Eagle Mountain) that hired a winemaker who twice produced Wine Spectator\'s #1 Chardonnay in the world and outsold 7,000 US wineries in its first six months. That\'s not nothing. The state has no designated AVA yet, which puts it behind neighboring North Carolina (250+ wineries, Yadkin Valley AVA), but the Upstate Blue Ridge foothills around Greenville and Travelers Rest are building real momentum. The coast serves the tourism crowd with sweet muscadine and fruit wines that pair perfectly with a beach vacation. The honest reality: most SC wineries lean heavily on muscadine (Noble, Carlos, Scuppernong) and imported juice from California, Washington, and Italy. But the quality gap is closing, the tasting rooms are genuinely fun, and a handful of producers are making wines that would surprise anyone who shows up expecting nothing. Grab a flight, sit on a porch with mountain or ocean views, and support a scene that\'s working hard to earn its place.',

  tagline: 'The State That Said "Hold My Margarita" and Made Wine Out of Avocados',
  overview: 'Let\'s be honest: Florida is not Napa. It\'s not Bordeaux. It\'s not even South Carolina. What it is, improbably, is the second-largest wine-consuming state in America, with a wine industry valued at $15 billion and roughly 90 wine producers working with 989 acres of vineyards. The problem? Almost every drop consumed is made somewhere else. Florida drinks California\'s wine, tips its hat, and says "thanks, we\'ll take it from here" by making wine out of Key limes, avocados, and whatever else falls off a tree in a hurricane. The state\'s war with proper winemaking goes back four centuries. Spanish colonizers were producing wine from native muscadine grapes 150 years before anyone made wine in California. Then Pierce\'s disease showed up, killed virtually every traditional grapevine, and Florida was left with three options: muscadine grapes (the only vine tough enough to survive hurricanes, lightning, and 100% humidity), tropical fruit wines (mango, lychee, passion fruit, and yes, avocado), and imported juice from California, Washington, Chile, and Italy. A genuine breakthrough arrived in late 2025 when UF/IFAS researchers successfully grew Pierce\'s disease-resistant vinifera grapes in Citra, Florida. If that works at scale, everything changes. Until then, embrace the absurdity. Order the avocado wine. You\'re in Florida. And honestly? Some of it is actually pretty good.',

    description: 'The Keys\' only legitimate "winery" (it\'s technically a meadery, which is classified as wine). Jeff makes small-batch meads from local Florida honey and Keys fruit, plus the Lost Viking Distillery on-site producing Honeyshine, Beekeeper\'s Cask (bourbon-style), Key Lime Cello, and Tiki Java (espresso + vanilla). $8 for 10 pours. Beehive on display. Board games. The owner will take you "in back" for a tour. Currently undergoing ownership change, so call ahead. The fact that someone looked at Key Largo and said "I should start a meadery here" is the most Florida Keys thing imaginable, and we salute it.',

    description: '$1 for four wines. One dollar. At Henscratch Farms, 101 free-range laying hens roam through 10 acres of muscadine and scuppernong vines. You can gather your own eggs, pick your own grapes (Aug-Sep), stomp grapes at the annual festival, and sit on a cracker-style porch while farm dogs nap at your feet. Wines include Country White, Country Red, Country Blueberry, and "Foot Stomped" (made Lucy-style during the grape stomp). There\'s also a pig. This is Florida at its most charmingly absurd, and at $1 a tasting, it\'s the best value in American wine tourism.',
