You're at dinner with three friends. Everyone orders a glass of the house Chardonnay at $14 each. Four glasses: $56. Meanwhile, a bottle of the same Chardonnay sits on the list at $48.

You just paid $56 for less wine than a $48 bottle would have given you. This happens at restaurants every night, and it's the single most common way diners overpay for wine.

Understanding the math behind restaurant wine pricing turns you from a passive consumer into a strategic one. Here's the breakdown.

## How Restaurant Wine Markup Works

### Bottle Markup

Most restaurants mark up wine bottles between 2.5 and 4 times their wholesale cost. A bottle the restaurant purchased for $10 from a distributor appears on the list at $30 to $40. Higher-end restaurants in expensive markets (Manhattan, San Francisco) sometimes push to 4-5x, while casual spots and BYOB-friendly restaurants may keep it at 2-2.5x.

This markup covers more than just the liquid. It pays for glassware (wine glasses break constantly), storage (proper wine storage costs money), staff training, the sommelier's salary, insurance on inventory, and the risk of wines going unsold.

Here's the thing about bottle markup: it's actually the more reasonable pricing model. The restaurant needs to make money on wine, and 2.5-4x wholesale is an accepted industry standard. Where the economics get aggressive is by the glass.

### By-the-Glass Markup

A standard wine bottle holds 750ml, which yields about [five 5-ounce glasses](/wine-101/glasses-of-wine-in-a-bottle). Most restaurants price a single glass at roughly 25-33% of the bottle's retail price, which means one glass costs about what the restaurant paid for the entire bottle wholesale.

Let's trace the math:

The restaurant buys a bottle for $10 wholesale. They put it on the list at $40 for the bottle. They pour five glasses at $13-15 each. Five glasses at $14 = $70 total revenue from the same bottle they'd sell intact for $40.

By-the-glass wine generates 50-75% more revenue per bottle than selling it whole. This is why every restaurant wants you to order glasses and why the by-the-glass section is prominently placed.

### The Markup Comparison

| Pricing Model | Typical Markup | Revenue per $10 Wholesale Bottle |
|--------------|---------------|--------------------------------|
| Full bottle | 2.5-4x | $25-40 |
| By the glass (5 pours) | 5-7x total | $50-75 |
| Premium/reserve glass pours | 6-8x total | $60-80 |

## The Break-Even Math

The decision between glasses and a bottle comes down to simple arithmetic. Here's how to run it at the table.

**Step 1:** Find a wine on the bottle list that matches what you'd order by the glass. Note the bottle price.

**Step 2:** Check the by-the-glass price for the same or comparable wine.

**Step 3:** Divide the bottle price by the glass price. That's your break-even number of glasses.

**Example:** Bottle is $48. Glass is $15. 48 ÷ 15 = 3.2. If you'll drink more than three glasses of this wine at the table, the bottle saves money.

**The general rule:** If three or more people at the table want the same style of wine, a bottle almost always wins. If only two people are drinking the same thing, a bottle sometimes wins (do the math). If everyone wants different wines, glasses are the way to go.

### Real-World Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Four people, all drinking the same red.**
Four glasses at $16 each = $64. A bottle of the same wine costs $52. The bottle saves $12 and gives you five glasses instead of four. Clear bottle win.

**Scenario 2: Couple sharing a bottle.**
Two glasses at $15 each = $30. A bottle costs $48. Two glasses gives you 10 ounces total. A bottle gives you 25 ounces. The bottle costs $18 more but delivers 2.5 times the wine. If you'll each have two glasses, the bottle is the obvious play.

**Scenario 3: Four people, all wanting different things.**
One wants Sauvignon Blanc, one wants Chardonnay, one wants Pinot Noir, one wants Cabernet. Glasses are the right call. Forcing everyone onto one bottle to save money defeats the purpose of dining out.

**Scenario 4: Two people, one drinking more than the other.**
If one person will have two glasses and the other will have one, three glasses costs about the same as a bottle but gives you less wine. Open the bottle, have the lighter drinker take one glass, and the other takes two. Offer the remaining two glasses to the table or enjoy them yourself. You're still ahead.

## Where the Real Value Hides

### Look Past the Glass List

The by-the-glass selection is typically limited to 8-15 wines. The bottle list might have 50-200 options. The [full list](/wine-101/how-to-read-a-wine-list) contains wines from smaller producers, less common regions, and more interesting styles that the restaurant can't offer by the glass because turnover would be too slow.

This is where the best value lives. A Greek Assyrtiko or a Portuguese Alvarinho might sit on the bottle list at $38 while the comparable "safe" Sauvignon Blanc by the glass runs $15. Two glasses of the Sauvignon Blanc costs $30 for 10 ounces. The Assyrtiko bottle costs $38 for 25 ounces. The bottle is more interesting wine at a better per-ounce price.

### Second-Tier Regions

Restaurants know that customers comparison-shop familiar wines. If you know that a bottle of Veuve Clicquot costs $55 at the store, seeing it at $120 on a wine list creates sticker shock.

Wines from less recognized regions don't trigger that comparison. A bottle from the Douro Valley, Rueda, the Languedoc, or the Finger Lakes might carry a more modest markup because the restaurant knows you're not price-anchored. These wines often represent the best dollar-for-dollar value on any list.

### Half-Bottles

When available, half-bottles (375ml, about 2.5 glasses) are a smart middle ground. They let couples or small parties try two different wines with two courses without committing to full bottles. The per-ounce markup is slightly higher than full bottles but lower than by-the-glass pricing.

Some restaurants have a strong half-bottle program specifically to give diners this flexibility. If you see more than 4-5 half-bottle options on a list, the restaurant is signaling that they value pairing versatility. Take advantage of it.

## When Glasses Make Sense

The bottle isn't always the right call. There are legitimate reasons to order by the glass.

**Everyone wants something different.** The entire point of dining out is enjoying what you want. If your table has varied preferences, forcing a single bottle on everyone saves money but costs enjoyment. Not worth it.

**You're eating light.** If you're having a one-course meal or a light lunch, a single glass might be all you want. Ordering a bottle to "get the value" and then drinking more than you intended isn't actually saving you anything.

**You want to explore.** Ordering different glasses across courses (a Sauvignon Blanc with appetizers, a Pinot Noir with your entree, a glass of Champagne to finish) gives you a tasting-menu experience with [wine pairing](/wine-101/wine-and-food-pairing). The per-glass premium is the price of variety.

**You're the only one drinking wine.** A full bottle is 25 ounces. If you're the only drinker, that's five glasses. Unless you're settling in for a long evening, a glass or two is the responsible play.

**The wine-by-the-glass program is exceptional.** Some restaurants invest heavily in their glass program, using preservation systems (Coravin, argon gas) to offer premium wines by the glass that would normally only be available by the bottle. If a restaurant is pouring Grand Cru Burgundy or aged Barolo by the glass, that's an experience worth the premium.

## The Sneaky Value Moves

### The "Almost a Bottle" Play

If three glasses of the same wine cost nearly as much as the bottle, ask your server: "Would it make sense for us to just grab a bottle?" Sometimes they'll confirm what you already know. Other times they'll let you know the bottle version is a different vintage or producer. Either way, you've made the smart move.

### Ask About Featured Wines

Many restaurants have a "feature" or "wine of the moment" that's priced to move. These are often bottles the wine director is excited about, purchased at a good price, and marked up less than the rest of the list. They're usually highlighted somewhere on the list or mentioned verbally. Ask about them.

### Split Bottles Across Courses

Instead of one bottle for the whole meal, consider two half-bottles or one bottle for appetizers (white) and one for entrees (red). The total cost might be slightly more, but you get appropriate pairings throughout the meal, which elevates the entire dining experience.

### The "Order a Bottle and a Glass" Strategy

If three people are having red and one wants white, order a bottle of the red and one glass of white. Three people sharing a bottle costs the same as three glasses but delivers more wine. The white-wine drinker gets exactly what they want. Everyone wins.

## The Bottom Line

Restaurant wine pricing isn't designed to rip you off, but it is designed to maximize revenue. Knowing how the math works puts you in control.

The simplest rule: if three or more people want the same wine, order a bottle. If two people want the same wine, do the math at the table. If everyone wants different things, embrace the glasses and enjoy the variety.

The best value at any restaurant is the bottle from an unfamiliar region in the middle of the price range. The worst value is the automatic glass-pour default that most tables fall into without thinking about it.

Think about the math for ten seconds. You'll drink better wine and spend less money doing it.
