You have a bottle of wine at home that you've been saving for a special dinner. Maybe it's a birth-year vintage, a wine from a memorable trip, or a bottle you scored that the restaurant would charge three times what you paid for it.

Can you bring it to the restaurant? In many cases, yes. There's a well-established protocol for it, and when done right, it's one of the most enjoyable ways to dine out. Done wrong, it's a faux pas that makes everyone uncomfortable.

Here's how to do it right.

## What Is a Corkage Fee?

A corkage fee is the charge a restaurant levies when you bring your own bottle of wine. It covers the service provided: opening the bottle, providing proper glassware, pouring, and cleaning up. It also partially compensates for the revenue the restaurant loses by not selling you a bottle from their own list.

### Typical Corkage Fee Ranges

| Restaurant Level | Typical Corkage Fee |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Casual / BYOB-friendly | $0-15 |
| Mid-range | $15-30 |
| Upscale | $25-50 |
| Fine dining | $35-75+ |
| Top wine-focused restaurants | $50-100+ (or declined) |

Some restaurants charge a flat fee per bottle. Others charge per person. A few high-end spots charge no corkage but have strict policies about which wines you can bring (nothing on their current list, for example). And some restaurants don't allow outside wine at all. Always call ahead.

### BYOB Restaurants

In many cities, particularly Philadelphia, parts of New Jersey, and some neighborhoods in New York and Chicago, BYOB restaurants are a specific category. They don't have a liquor license and can't sell alcohol. Instead, they invite you to bring your own wine (and sometimes beer and spirits). These restaurants typically charge no corkage fee. They're one of the best values in dining: great food, your own wine, no markup.

## When BYOB Makes Sense

### The Special Occasion Bottle

You have a 2005 Burgundy you've been cellaring. You want to drink it with a great meal. No restaurant is going to have this specific bottle on their list, and even if they did, the markup would be enormous. This is the ideal BYOB scenario: a wine with sentimental or collector value that you can't replicate from the restaurant's inventory.

### The Financial Play

Let's do the math. You bought a solid Napa Cabernet for $40. On a restaurant wine list, that same bottle would likely be $100-160 (2.5-4x markup). Even with a $35 corkage fee, you're paying $75 total ($40 + $35) versus $100-160 from the list. That's a meaningful savings on a bottle you already know you love.

The financial case weakens as corkage fees rise and bottle costs drop. Bringing a $15 bottle and paying a $30 corkage fee doesn't make economic sense. The sweet spot: bottles you purchased for $30-100+ where the restaurant markup would be significant.

### The Wine Geek Dinner

When you and friends are doing a themed tasting (all Barolo vintages, a horizontal of 2019 Burgundy, a blind tasting of Cabernet from different regions), bringing your own bottles is the only way to create that experience at a restaurant. Many restaurants welcome this because the table will likely order food enthusiastically and perhaps a bottle or two from the list as well.

## The Etiquette Rules

### Rule 1: Never Bring a Wine That's on Their List

This is the cardinal rule. If the restaurant carries Caymus Cabernet and you walk in with a bottle of Caymus Cabernet, you're telling them you'd rather not pay their markup on a wine they're already offering. It's the equivalent of bringing outside food to a restaurant because you think theirs is overpriced.

Before visiting, check the restaurant's [wine list](/wine-101/how-to-read-a-wine-list) online (most post it on their website). If you can't find it, call ahead and ask: "We'd like to bring a bottle of [wine]. Is that available on your list?" If it is, choose a different bottle.

### Rule 2: Call Ahead

Always confirm the corkage policy before you show up. Ask three questions: Do you allow outside wine? What is the corkage fee? Are there any restrictions (number of bottles, specific nights, etc.)?

Some restaurants allow corkage every night. Others restrict it to certain evenings. Some limit you to one or two bottles per table. Some waive corkage if you also order a bottle from their list. Knowing this in advance prevents awkward negotiations at the table.

### Rule 3: Offer the Sommelier or Server a Taste

This is the single most elegant gesture in the BYOB playbook. When the bottle is opened, pour a small taste and offer it to the sommelier or server: "Would you like to try this?"

This does three things. It shows respect for their expertise. It acknowledges that they're providing service even though you didn't buy from their list. And it creates a moment of shared enjoyment that transforms the interaction from transactional to collegial.

Not every sommelier will accept (some restaurants prohibit staff from drinking during service), but the offer is always appreciated.

### Rule 4: Don't Bring Cheap Wine

If you're going to bring your own bottle, make it something worth the occasion. Bringing a $9 grocery store wine to a fine dining restaurant and paying $50 corkage looks more like you're trying to game the system than celebrating a special bottle.

The implicit contract of BYOB is: "I have something special that I can't get from your list." Honoring that contract means bringing something with genuine quality, sentimental value, or collector interest.

### Rule 5: Order from the List Too

The most gracious BYOB move is to order a bottle (or at least glasses) from the restaurant's list in addition to your brought bottle. This signals that you respect their wine program and you're not just trying to avoid paying for their wine entirely.

This is especially important at restaurants where the wine list is a significant part of the dining experience. The wine director put thought and effort into building that list. Engaging with it, even partially, shows appreciation.

Many restaurants will waive or reduce the corkage fee if you order a bottle from their list. This is sometimes stated as policy, sometimes offered as a goodwill gesture. Either way, it's a win for everyone.

## How to Handle the Logistics

### Transporting the Wine

Bring the bottle in a wine bag or wrapped in a cloth. Don't pull it out of a grocery bag. If it's a special bottle, the presentation matters. A proper wine bag costs $5 and signals that you take this seriously.

If the wine needs to be chilled (white, sparkling, rosé), transport it in a cooler or insulated bag. Getting the [serving temperature](/wine-101/wine-serving-temperature) right matters. Arriving with a warm Champagne and asking the restaurant to chill it for 30 minutes delays your meal and occupies their ice bucket.

For red wine that's been cellared, try to keep it at cellar temperature during transit. A wine that's been bouncing around in a hot car all afternoon needs time to settle before drinking.

### At the Restaurant

Hand the bottle to your server when you're seated. Say something like: "We brought a bottle tonight. I called ahead about corkage." They'll take it from there.

The server will present the bottle, open it, pour a taste for you to check, and then serve the table, just like any other bottle. Let them do their job. They're providing full wine service and should be treated accordingly.

### Decanting

If you're bringing a wine that benefits from decanting (older reds with sediment, young [tannic](/wine-101/what-is-tannin) reds that need air), you can ask the restaurant to decant it. Most upscale restaurants have decanters on hand and will do this as part of the corkage service. At casual spots, it's less common, so you might bring your own decanter or just plan to let the wine open up in the glass.

## Tipping on BYOB Bottles

This is where people get confused. Here's the straightforward guidance.

**Tip on the full meal total, including any bottles you ordered from the list, at 18-20%.** That's standard.

**For the BYOB bottle:** Add a tip amount that acknowledges the full wine service you received. A common approach is to tip $5-10 per BYOB bottle on top of your standard tip, or to tip as if the BYOB bottle were a modestly priced bottle from their list.

Some people tip on the corkage fee at the standard rate. Others add a flat amount per bottle. The exact math matters less than the principle: you received wine service (opening, pouring, glassware, attentiveness) and should compensate for it, even though you didn't buy the wine from the restaurant.

What you should not do: tip only on the food because "the wine was mine." The staff served the wine with the same care and attention they'd give any bottle. Acknowledge that.

## When NOT to Bring Your Own

**When the restaurant doesn't allow it.** Some restaurants, especially those with extensive wine programs curated by a master sommelier, don't accept outside wine. Respect that. Their wine program is part of the experience they're selling.

**When you don't have something special.** If you're bringing wine just to avoid the restaurant markup on something ordinary, you're misusing the convention. BYOB is for special bottles, not for cost-cutting on everyday wine.

**When you're at a very casual restaurant.** A pizza place or a taco joint probably doesn't have corkage policies or proper wine service. If you want wine with casual food, order what they have or go to a dedicated BYOB spot.

**When you're dining as a guest.** If someone else is hosting dinner, don't bring your own bottle unless you've discussed it with the host. Bringing outside wine to someone else's dinner can feel like you're commandeering the wine selection.

## The Corkage Fee Waiver Play

Some restaurants have an unwritten (or written) policy: buy one bottle from our list and we'll waive corkage on one bottle you brought. This is the best of both worlds. You get to enjoy your special bottle, the restaurant gets a bottle sale, and the corkage fee disappears.

Ask when you call ahead: "Do you waive corkage if we order from the list?" If yes, plan accordingly. Order the restaurant's bottle for the first course and bring your special bottle for the main course. You're now dining at peak experience with minimal extra cost.

## The Bottom Line

BYOB is a privilege, not a right. When exercised with good etiquette, genuine appreciation, and a bottle worth the occasion, it's one of the great pleasures of restaurant dining. You get to drink exactly what you want, share something meaningful with the people you're dining with, and enjoy professional wine service while you do it.

Call ahead. Don't bring anything on their list. Offer the sommelier a taste. Order from the list too. Tip generously. Follow those five rules, and you'll be welcome back with your next special bottle.
