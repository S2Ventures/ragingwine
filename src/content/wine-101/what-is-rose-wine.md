Rosé went from punchline to phenomenon in about a decade. What was once dismissed as "the pink one" is now the fastest-growing wine category in the U.S., and 55% of American wine drinkers say they enjoy it.

But most people who drink rosé couldn't explain how it's made, why some are dry and some are sweet, or why a $12 bottle from Provence can taste completely different from a $7 White Zinfandel. Time to fix that.

## How Rosé Is Actually Made

Rosé is not red wine mixed with white wine. That's a persistent myth, and with very few exceptions (some Champagne rosé blends red and white), it's wrong.

Rosé is made from red grapes with limited skin contact. The process looks like this:

**Step 1:** Red grapes are crushed, and the juice begins soaking with the skins, just like red wine production.

**Step 2:** After a few hours to a couple of days (compared to weeks for red wine), the juice is separated from the skins. The brief contact extracts some color and a touch of tannin, but far less than a full red wine.

**Step 3:** The now-pink juice is fermented and bottled like a white wine.

That's it. The shorter the skin contact, the paler the color and the lighter the wine. Longer contact produces deeper salmon and coral colors with a bit more body.

There's also a method called **saignée** (sahn-YAY), which means "bleeding." Winemakers making red wine will sometimes drain off some juice early in fermentation to concentrate the remaining red wine. That drained-off juice becomes rosé as a byproduct. Saignée rosés tend to be slightly darker and more full-bodied.

## Dry Rosé vs. Sweet Rosé

This is the great divide in rosé, and it confuses a lot of people because both exist on the same shelf.

**Dry rosé** has little to no residual sugar. It tastes crisp, refreshing, and savory. Provence-style rosé is the gold standard: pale pink, bone dry, with watermelon, strawberry, and herbal notes. This is the rosé that gets paired with serious food and doesn't need summer to justify itself.

**Sweet rosé** (White Zinfandel, some blush wines) retains noticeable sugar. It tastes candied, fruity, and easy-drinking. White Zinfandel was the best-selling wine in America for much of the 1990s, and it's still popular today.

Both are legitimate wines. But they're as different from each other as a dry Champagne is from a sweet Moscato. If you tried one and didn't like it, the other style might win you over.

**How to tell from the label:** Dry rosés from Provence, Navarra (Spain), and the Willamette Valley are almost always dry. If the label says "White Zinfandel," "Blush," or comes from a mass-market brand with a cutesy name, it's probably sweet. ABV is a clue too: dry rosés typically run 12-13.5% ABV, while sweet rosés are often lower (9-11%).

## The Major Rosé Styles

### Provence (France)
Pale salmon pink. Bone dry. Watermelon, peach, garrigue herbs. The style everyone is trying to emulate. Light-bodied and mineral. Best chilled to 45-50°F.

### Tavel (France)
The darkest, boldest rosé you'll find. Deeper color, more body, more tannin structure than Provence. Almost a light red. Excellent with food, especially grilled meats.

### Navarra (Spain)
Made from Garnacha. Dry, fruity, strawberry-forward, and priced aggressively. Some of the best value rosé in the world lives here.

### Willamette Valley (Oregon)
Pinot Noir rosé. Delicate, crisp, with red berry and citrus notes. A domestic alternative to Provence at similar quality.

### White Zinfandel (California)
Sweet, coral-pink, low alcohol. Strawberry candy and watermelon. Not pretending to be Provence, and there's nothing wrong with that.

## Rosé and Food: Not Just for Summer

The biggest misconception about rosé is that it's seasonal. Dry rosé is one of the most versatile food wines year-round.

**What rosé pairs well with:**

Salads and grain bowls, grilled chicken and fish, charcuterie boards, sushi, Thai and Vietnamese food, pizza (seriously), roast turkey, Mediterranean dishes (hummus, tabbouleh, grilled vegetables), and brunch (with or without eggs Benedict).

**Why it's so versatile:** Rosé sits at the intersection of red and white wine characteristics. It has the acidity and freshness of white wine with a hint of the body and fruit you get from reds. That makes it a bridge wine that works where neither pure red nor pure white is quite right.

**Thanksgiving dinner** might be rosé's greatest stage. The table includes turkey, cranberry sauce, sweet potatoes, stuffing, and gravy. No single red or white covers all of that. A dry rosé covers everything without clashing with anything.

## Top Regions and What to Spend

| Region | Style | Price Range | Try First |
|--------|-------|-------------|-----------|
| Provence, France | Pale, dry, elegant | $12-22 | Château Miraval, Whispering Angel |
| Tavel, France | Dark, bold, structured | $14-20 | E. Guigal Tavel |
| Navarra, Spain | Dry, fruity, value | $7-13 | Gran Feudo Rosado |
| Willamette Valley, OR | Delicate, crisp | $14-20 | Sokol Blosser, Erath |
| Bandol, France | Rich, complex, age-worthy | $18-30 | Domaine Tempier |
| Sancerre, France | Pinot Noir rosé, mineral | $18-25 | Pascal Jolivet |

## The Rise of "Gastronomic Rosé"

Something interesting has happened in the last five years: restaurants have started treating rosé as a serious food wine, not just a warm-weather pour. Top restaurants now keep dry rosé on their lists year-round, and sommeliers recommend it with main courses, not just appetizers.

This shift is driven by quality. The rosés coming from Provence, Bandol, and Tavel are complex, structured wines with real aging potential (top Bandol rosés can age 5-10 years). They're not disposable summer sippers. They're wines that reward attention.

The result: rosé is finally getting the respect it deserves. It's not a category to grow out of or feel embarrassed about ordering. It's a legitimate wine style with centuries of history, excellent food-pairing versatility, and quality that ranges from casual to world-class.

Order it in February. Order it in August. Order it whenever you want a wine that refreshes without sacrificing substance. That's what rosé does best.
